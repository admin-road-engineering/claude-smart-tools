# Model Selection Improvements (August 2025)

## Overview

This document details the enhanced model selection system implemented to address developer feedback about context awareness and tool effectiveness. The improvements optimize AI model assignments across all 14 engines based on task complexity, analysis type, and content characteristics.

## Problem Statement

**Original Issues:**
- Context awareness problems with some tools providing poor analysis quality
- Inconsistent model assignments not matching task complexity
- Dynamic selection too complex for a personal tool
- Some tools using suboptimal models for their analysis type

**Developer Feedback:**
> "Maybe review the tasks and their complexity against the model chosen, let's hardcode this for now instead of dynamically choosing it."

## Solution: Simplified Model Assignment Strategy

### 1. Three-Tier Model Hierarchy

#### **Pro Tier (3 engines)** - Complex reasoning and dialogue
- **analyze_code**: UPGRADED to Pro for enhanced context awareness
- **review_output**: Technical dialogue and collaboration  
- **full_analysis**: Multi-engine orchestration

#### **Flash Tier (7 engines)** - Balanced analysis and security
- **check_quality**: Security-critical analysis
- **map_dependencies**: Graph analysis quality
- **performance_profiler**: Flow analysis
- **analyze_logs**: UPGRADED from Flash-lite for better log processing
- **analyze_database**: UPGRADED for SQL understanding and schema analysis
- **analyze_docs**: UPGRADED for document synthesis
- **analyze_test_coverage**: UPGRADED for test analysis and coverage insights

#### **Flash-Lite Tier (4 engines)** - Simple pattern matching
- **search_code**: Pattern matching and text search
- **api_contract_checker**: Schema parsing and validation
- **interface_inconsistency_detector**: Pattern matching for consistency
- **config_validator**: Simple configuration validation

### 2. Key Upgrades Made

#### **Major Upgrades:**
1. **analyze_code**: Flash → **Pro**
   - **Reason**: Context awareness was the #1 developer complaint
   - **Benefit**: Better architectural understanding and code comprehension

2. **analyze_logs**: Flash-lite → **Flash**
   - **Reason**: Log analysis requires more semantic understanding than simple pattern matching
   - **Benefit**: Better anomaly detection and pattern recognition

3. **analyze_database**: Flash-lite → **Flash**
   - **Reason**: SQL understanding and schema analysis benefit from enhanced reasoning
   - **Benefit**: More comprehensive database analysis

4. **analyze_docs**: Flash-lite → **Flash**
   - **Reason**: Document synthesis requires understanding context and relationships
   - **Benefit**: Better documentation analysis and synthesis

5. **analyze_test_coverage**: Flash-lite → **Flash**
   - **Reason**: Test analysis requires understanding code complexity and coverage gaps
   - **Benefit**: More insightful test recommendations

### 3. Simplified Dynamic Upgrade Rules

Reduced from complex heuristics to **4 clear priority rules**:

```python
# Priority 1: Comprehensive always gets Pro
if detail_level == "comprehensive":
    return GeminiModel.PRO.value

# Priority 2: Security focus upgrades Flash-lite to Flash minimum
if focus == "security" and base_model == GeminiModel.FLASH_LITE.value:
    return GeminiModel.FLASH.value

# Priority 3: Large content (>2MB) gets Pro
if content_size and content_size > 2_000_000:
    return GeminiModel.PRO.value

# Priority 4: Medium content (>500KB) upgrades Flash-lite to Flash
if content_size and content_size > 500_000 and base_model == GeminiModel.FLASH_LITE.value:
    return GeminiModel.FLASH.value
```

### 4. Removed Complexity

#### **Eliminated:**
- Complex heuristic scoring systems
- Multiple parameter-based model selection
- Runtime model switching based on performance
- Over-engineered dynamic selection algorithms

#### **Preserved:**
- Essential content-size based upgrades
- Security-focus model upgrades
- Comprehensive detail level upgrades
- Fallback logic for rate limits

## Implementation Details

### File Changes

#### **gemini-engines/src/services/model_selection_router.py**
- Updated `DEFAULT_MODELS` dictionary with new assignments
- Simplified `select_model()` method from 150+ lines to 90 lines
- Removed redundant `analyze_logs` hardcoded override
- Added clear logging for upgrade decisions

#### **Configuration Support**
- All model assignments configurable via environment variables
- Dynamic upgrades can be disabled for testing
- Content size thresholds are adjustable

### Code Example

```python
class ModelSelectionRouter:
    """
    Simplified model selection following GEMINI.md principles:
    1. Pro for collaborative dialogue only
    2. Flash for security-critical or quality analysis  
    3. Flash-lite for everything else (cost-conscious)
    """
    
    DEFAULT_MODELS = {
        # Pro Tier: Complex reasoning and dialogue (3 tools)
        "review_output": GeminiModel.PRO.value,
        "analyze_code": GeminiModel.PRO.value,                # UPGRADED for context awareness
        "full_analysis": GeminiModel.PRO.value,               # Multi-engine orchestration
        
        # Flash Tier: Balanced analysis (7 tools)
        "check_quality": GeminiModel.FLASH.value,             # Security-critical analysis
        "map_dependencies": GeminiModel.FLASH.value,          # Graph analysis quality
        "performance_profiler": GeminiModel.FLASH.value,      # Flow analysis quality  
        "analyze_logs": GeminiModel.FLASH.value,              # UPGRADED from flash-lite
        "analyze_database": GeminiModel.FLASH.value,          # UPGRADED for SQL understanding
        "analyze_docs": GeminiModel.FLASH.value,              # UPGRADED for synthesis
        "analyze_test_coverage": GeminiModel.FLASH.value,     # UPGRADED for test analysis
        
        # Flash-lite Tier: Simple pattern matching (4 tools)
        "search_code": GeminiModel.FLASH_LITE.value,          # Pattern matching
        "api_contract_checker": GeminiModel.FLASH_LITE.value, # Schema parsing
        "interface_inconsistency_detector": GeminiModel.FLASH_LITE.value, # Pattern matching
