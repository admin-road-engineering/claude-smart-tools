# Cross-Engine Correlation and Conflict Resolution Framework

## ✅ Implementation Complete (Phase 3)

This document summarizes the implementation of the cross-engine correlation and conflict resolution framework for the Smart Tools system.

## 🎯 Overview

The correlation framework provides intelligent analysis of results from multiple engines, detecting patterns, identifying conflicts, and resolving contradictions to provide more reliable and coherent multi-engine analyses.

## 📁 Files Created

### 1. **Core Framework** (`src/services/correlation_framework.py`)
- **CorrelationFramework**: Main class for correlation analysis
- **Pattern Extraction**: Extracts metrics, findings, recommendations from results
- **Correlation Detection**: Identifies relationships between engine results
- **Conflict Identification**: Detects contradictions and discrepancies
- **Conflict Resolution**: Applies strategies to resolve conflicts
- **Key Features**:
  - Semantic similarity matching for text-based findings
  - Numerical correlation for metrics
  - Category-based correlation
  - Contradiction detection algorithms
  - Multi-level conflict severity (critical, moderate, minor)

### 2. **Resolution Strategies** (`src/services/resolution_strategies.py`)
- **ConsensusStrategy**: Uses majority agreement among engines
- **ExpertWeightingStrategy**: Weights engines by domain expertise
- **ConfidenceBasedStrategy**: Prefers high-confidence results
- **HierarchicalStrategy**: Uses predefined engine priority
- **ManualReviewStrategy**: Flags for human review (fallback)
- **CompositeStrategy**: Combines multiple strategies
- **StrategySelector**: Intelligent strategy selection based on conflict type

### 3. **Configuration System** (`src/config/correlation_config.py`)

- Engine expertise matrix for 12 engines across 8 domains
- Resolution strategy preferences
- Display and performance settings
- Environment variable overrides

### 4. **Smart Tool Integration**
#### Updated Files:
- **base_smart_tool.py**: 
  - Added correlation analysis methods
  - Extended SmartToolResult with correlation data
  - Added correlation report formatting
  
- **validate_tool.py**:
  - Integrated correlation analysis for validation results

## 🔧 Key Algorithms

### Correlation Detection
```python
# Similarity calculation combines:
- Text similarity (using SequenceMatcher)
- Category overlap (Jaccard similarity)
- Metric correlation (percentage difference)
- Finding overlap (set intersection)
```

### Conflict Types
1. **Contradictory Results**: Direct contradictions in findings
2. **Metric Discrepancy**: Significant differences in numerical values
3. **Recommendation Conflicts**: Opposing suggestions

### Resolution Confidence Scoring
- **High** (>0.8): Strong agreement or clear expert preference
- **Medium** (0.5-0.8): Moderate consensus or confidence
- **Low** (<0.5): Weak agreement, manual review suggested

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Enhanced Accuracy**
- Correlations validate findings across multiple engines
- Reduces false positives through cross-validation
- Identifies high-confidence results

### 2. **Conflict Resolution**
- Systematic handling of contradictory results
- Multiple resolution strategies for different scenarios
- Clear explanation of resolution decisions

### 3. **Improved Synthesis**
- More coherent multi-engine reports
- Highlights agreements and disagreements
- Provides confidence scores for findings

### 4. **Transparency**
- Shows correlation strength between engines
- Explains conflict resolution rationale
- Flags low-confidence results for review

## 📊 Engine Expertise Matrix

The system includes expertise weights for engines across domains:

| Engine | Security | Performance | Quality | Architecture | Testing |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------|--------------|---------|
| check_quality | 0.95 | 0.85 | 0.90 | 0.60 | 0.70 |
| analyze_code | 0.60 | 0.50 | 0.80 | 0.95 | 0.60 |
| performance_profiler | 0.30 | 1.00 | 0.40 | 0.50 | 0.30 |
| analyze_test_coverage | 0.50 | 0.30 | 0.85 | 0.40 | 1.00 |
| config_validator | 0.85 | 0.50 | 0.60 | 0.50 | 0.40 |

## 🚀 Usage

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Enable/disable correlation analysis
ENABLE_CORRELATION_ANALYSIS=true

# Correlation thresholds
CORRELATION_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.3
CORRELATION_STRONG_THRESHOLD=0.8
METRIC_DISCREPANCY_THRESHOLD=0.3

# Display settings
MAX_CORRELATIONS_DISPLAY=5
MAX_CONFLICTS_DISPLAY=3

# Resolution preferences
PREFERRED_RESOLUTION_STRATEGIES=composite,expert,consensus
```

### In Smart Tools
The correlation framework automatically activates when:
- Multiple engines are used in analysis
- Correlation is enabled (default: true)
- Results contain analyzable patterns

### Example Output
```markdown
## 🔗 Engine Correlations
- check_quality confirms analyze_code (strong, confidence: 0.85)
- performance_profiler complements analyze_logs (moderate, confidence: 0.62)

## ⚠️ Detected Conflicts
- Conflict (moderate): metric_discrepancy between 3 engines

## ✅ Conflict Resolutions
- Resolved using expert_weighted: Selected check_quality based on security expertise
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest tests/test_correlation_framework.py -v
```

Test coverage includes:
- Pattern extraction from various result formats
- Correlation detection algorithms
- Conflict identification logic
