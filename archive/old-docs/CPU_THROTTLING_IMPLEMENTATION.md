# CPU Throttling Implementation Summary

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - January 2025

Successfully implemented CPU throttling system for Claude Smart Tools to prevent terminal freezing and VS Code crashes, based on the proven solution from claude-gemini-mcp.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before**: Claude Smart Tools could cause terminal freezing and VS Code crashes during intensive operations
**After**: System remains responsive with adaptive CPU throttling and periodic yielding

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **`src/services/cpu_throttler.py`** - Singleton CPU throttling service
   - Real-time CPU monitoring using psutil
   - Adaptive yielding based on 80% CPU threshold  
   - Configurable parameters for fine-tuning
   - Heavy operation monitoring context manager

2. **`src/config.py`** - Unified configuration parameters
   - `MAX_CPU_USAGE_PERCENT=80.0` - CPU threshold for throttling
   - `PROCESSING_YIELD_INTERVAL_MS=100` - Event loop yield frequency
   - `CPU_CHECK_INTERVAL=10` - Operations between CPU checks
   - `API_CALL_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS=0.5` - API monitoring interval

3. **`src/clients/gemini_client.py`** - CPU-safe API calls
   - `_cpu_safe_api_call()` method with 500ms monitoring intervals
   - Verification-based threading (confirmed Gemini SDK is synchronous)

   - CPU yielding before and after engine execution
   - Heavy operation monitoring for long-running engines
   - Batch processing with CPU awareness

   - CPU throttling for multi-engine coordination
   - Batch processing with configurable batch sizes
   - Yielding between engine executions

6. **`src/smart_mcp_server.py`** - Server-level initialization
   - CPU throttler singleton initialization at startup
   - Status logging and monitoring
   - Integration with all smart tools

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### CPU-Safe API Call Pattern
```python
async def _cpu_safe_api_call(self, model, prompt: str, timeout: float, model_name: str):
    # Create API task - model.generate_content is synchronous (verified)
    api_task = asyncio.create_task(
        asyncio.to_thread(model.generate_content, prompt)
    )
    
    # Monitor with 500ms check intervals
    while not api_task.done():
        # Yield CPU control and continue monitoring
        if self.cpu_throttler:
            await self.cpu_throttler.yield_if_needed()
```

### Smart Tool CPU Integration
```python
async def execute_multiple_engines(self, engine_names: List[str], **kwargs):
    # Use throttled batch processing for large engine sets
    async for batch in self.cpu_throttler.throttled_batch_processing(engine_names, batch_size=3):
        for engine_name in batch:
            results[engine_name] = await self.execute_engine(engine_name, **kwargs)
```

### Adaptive CPU Monitoring
```python
async def should_yield(self) -> bool:
    # Check CPU usage periodically
    cpu_usage = self._get_cpu_usage()
    if cpu_usage > self.max_cpu_percent:
        if not self._throttle_active:
            logger.warning(f"CPU usage high: {cpu_usage:.1f}% - activating throttling")
            self._throttle_active = True
        return True
```

3. ✅ **Configurable Parameters** - Tunable for different system requirements
4. ✅ **Singleton Pattern** - System-wide consistency and efficiency
5. ✅ **Validation Complete** - All tests passing, ready for use

## 🎯 Usage

CPU throttling is **automatically enabled** when the smart tools system starts. No user action required - the system will:

- Monitor CPU usage in real-time
- Yield control when CPU exceeds 80% threshold  
- Log throttling activity for monitoring
- Maintain responsiveness during heavy operations

The implementation successfully addresses the terminal freezing and VS Code crash issues while maintaining full functionality of all smart tools.
