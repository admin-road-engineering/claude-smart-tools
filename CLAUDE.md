def normalize_paths(paths_input: Any) -> List[str]:
    """Universal path normalization handling all input types"""
    # Handles: strings, Path objects, WindowsPath, lists, directories
    # Returns: List of absolute string paths for safe iteration
```

#### **2. Monkey Patch System**
```python
# Runtime patching of GeminiToolImplementations._collect_code_from_paths
# Ensures legacy engines receive properly normalized paths
# Applied automatically at engine initialization
```

#### **3. Engine Wrapper Preprocessing**
```python
# Direct path preprocessing in EngineWrapper.execute()
def _preprocess_path_inputs(self, kwargs):
    """Pre-process all path inputs to ensure they are lists"""
    # Converts single Path objects to lists before engine execution
    # Handles all path parameter types across 14 engines
```

- **Before**: Sequential execution, 13+ minutes for comprehensive analysis
- **After**: Parallel execution, 1-4 minutes (75-85% reduction)
- **Memory Safe**: Adaptive parallelism based on available memory
- **Error Resilient**: `return_exceptions=True` prevents single failure from stopping all tasks

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
# Memory-aware parallel execution
memory = psutil.virtual_memory()
max_parallel = 2 if memory.percent > 85 else 6

# Execute with semaphore limiting
semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_parallel)
async def run_with_semaphore(task):
    async with semaphore:
        return await task

results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

### **üìÅ Project Context Awareness**
**Problem Solved**: Smart Tools using their own internal CLAUDE.md instead of target project's context

**Context Files Now Read**:
- `CLAUDE.md` / `claude.md` - Claude-specific development guidelines
- `GEMINI.md` / `gemini.md` - Gemini-specific analysis instructions
- `README.md` / `readme.md` - Project documentation
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Hidden Claude configuration
- `.gemini/GEMINI.md` - Hidden Gemini configuration

**Implementation Features**:
- **Automatic Detection**: Finds project root from provided file paths
- **Multi-File Support**: Reads all context files and merges information
- **Intelligent Extraction**: Pulls security requirements, architecture notes, key requirements
- **Engine Integration**: Passes formatted context to all analysis engines
- **Caching**: Context cached per execution to avoid redundant reads

### **üíæ File Content Caching**
**Problem Solved**: Redundant file I/O operations slowing down analysis

**Cache Features**:
- **Timestamp Validation**: Checks file modification time for freshness
- **Configurable Extensions**: Control which file types to cache
- **Memory Limits**: Maximum files per directory to prevent memory bloat
- **Statistics Tracking**: Hit rate, miss rate, freshness rate monitoring

**Configuration** (Environment Variables):
```bash
ENABLE_FILE_CACHE=true                    # Enable/disable caching
CACHE_FILE_EXTENSIONS=.py,.js,.ts,.java   # File types to cache
CACHE_DIR_LIMIT=100                       # Max files per directory
```

### **VENV Compatibility Issue** ‚úÖ **FIXED & TESTED (August 20, 2025)**

- **Fast performance**: All tests completed within expected timeframes
- **Full functionality**: Multi-engine coordination working properly

**üìã Documentation**: Complete troubleshooting guide available at `docs/VENV_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

### **üö® Event Loop Blocking Crash Fix** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED (August 20, 2025)**

**Problem Solved**: VS Code and terminal crashes during intensive Smart Tools operations due to synchronous file I/O blocking the async event loop.

**üö® Before the Fix**
- **VS Code crashes**: Terminal freezing and VS Code becoming unresponsive
- **collaborate tool failures**: Specific reports of crashes when using the collaborate tool
- **Event loop blocking**: Synchronous `open()` and `os.path.getmtime()` calls blocking async operations
- **System instability**: Terminal applications crashing under heavy file processing loads

**‚úÖ After the Fix**
- **Zero crashes**: All 7 Smart Tools tested successfully without any crashes
- **Smooth operation**: VS Code and terminal remain responsive during intensive operations
- **True async**: All file operations now properly non-blocking
- **Stable performance**: 30-60 second execution times with no system instability

**üîß Technical Implementation**
Three critical fixes implemented:

1. **Async File Reading in `engine_wrapper.py`**:
   ```python
   # Before (blocking):
   with open(path, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as f:
       content = f.read()
   
   # After (non-blocking):
   async with aiofiles.open(path, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as f:
       content = await f.read()
   ```

2. **Async File Metadata in `base_smart_tool.py`**:
   ```python
   # Before (blocking):
   current_mtime = os.path.getmtime(file_path)
   
   # After (non-blocking):
   current_mtime = await asyncio.to_thread(os.path.getmtime, file_path)
   ```

3. **Async File System Checks**:
   ```python
   # Before (blocking):
   if path.is_file():
   
   # After (non-blocking):
   is_file = await asyncio.to_thread(path.is_file)
   if is_file:
   ```

**‚úÖ Validation Testing (August 20, 2025)**
Comprehensive crash-free testing completed:
- **collaborate**: ‚úÖ 30s execution, detailed code review, no crashes
- **understand**: ‚úÖ 30s execution, comprehensive analysis, stable
- **investigate**: ‚úÖ 45s execution, identified root causes, no issues
- **validate**: ‚úÖ 60s execution, security analysis, stable
- **propose_tests**: ‚úÖ 40s execution, test strategies, no crashes
- **deploy**: ‚úÖ 50s execution, production validation, stable
- **full_analysis**: ‚úÖ 35s execution, autonomous coordination, no issues

**üéØ Root Cause Analysis**
The investigate tool correctly identified that synchronous file operations in an async environment were blocking the event loop, causing Node.js-based applications (like VS Code) to freeze and eventually crash. The fix ensures all I/O operations are truly asynchronous.

### **üîß Complete Fix Implementation Details (August 18, 2025)**

The WindowsPath iteration error was resolved through a multi-layered approach:

#### **1. Root Cause**
- The `_collect_code_from_paths` method was missing from `GeminiToolImplementations` class
- When Path objects were passed to engines, they weren't being converted to iterable lists of strings
- The error `'WindowsPath' object is not iterable` occurred when code tried to iterate over a single Path object

#### **2. Fix Implementation Layers**

**Layer 1: GeminiToolImplementations (gemini-engines/src/services/gemini_tool_implementations.py)**
- Added complete `_collect_code_from_paths` method with proper WindowsPath handling
- Ensures paths parameter is always converted to a list of strings
- Handles both files and directories with proper extension filtering

**Layer 2: Smart Tool Level (src/smart_tools/base_smart_tool.py)**
- Added path normalization in `execute_engine` method
- Converts WindowsPath or single paths to list of strings before passing to engines
- Handles all common path parameter names (files, paths, sources, etc.)

**Layer 3: UnderstandTool Level (src/smart_tools/understand_tool.py)**
- Added input validation at the beginning of `execute` method
- Ensures files parameter is always a list of strings
- Provides fallback for unexpected input types

**Layer 4: Engine Wrapper (src/engines/engine_wrapper.py)**
- Enhanced `_apply_path_normalization_monkey_patch` to add missing method
- Includes complete implementation if `_collect_code_from_paths` doesn't exist
- Uses `types.MethodType` for proper method binding

**Layer 5: Path Utils (src/utils/path_utils.py)**
- Already had comprehensive `normalize_paths` function
- Handles all path input types and expands directories to file lists
- Provides centralized path normalization utility

#### **3. Testing Verification**
All 7 smart tools tested and confirmed working:
- ‚úÖ understand - Analyzes code architecture
- ‚úÖ investigate - Debugs issues  
- ‚úÖ validate - Quality checks
- ‚úÖ collaborate - Code reviews
- ‚úÖ propose_tests - Test coverage analysis
- ‚úÖ deploy - Deployment validation
- ‚úÖ full_analysis - Comprehensive orchestration

## üß† **Intelligent Routing Examples**

```bash
understand(files=["src/"], question="How does the payment system work?")
```
**Smart Routing Decision**:
- ‚úÖ Always includes `analyze_code` for architecture overview
- ‚úÖ Adds `search_code` because specific question provided ("payment system")  
- ‚úÖ Includes `analyze_docs` if README.md or docs/ found in files

**Result**: Comprehensive understanding combining architecture + specific patterns + documentation context

### **Example 2: Security Investigation** 
```bash
validate(files=["src/auth/", "config/"], validation_type="security")
```
**Smart Routing Decision**:
- ‚úÖ `check_quality` with focus="security" for vulnerability analysis
- ‚úÖ `config_validator` because config/ directory detected  
- ‚úÖ `interface_inconsistency_detector` for auth-related consistency

**Result**: Complete security assessment across code, configuration, and consistency

### **Example 3: Performance Debugging**
```bash
investigate(files=["src/api/", "logs/"], problem="slow API responses")
```
**Smart Routing Decision**:
- ‚úÖ `search_code` to find API-related patterns
- ‚úÖ `analyze_logs` because logs/ directory detected
- ‚úÖ `performance_profiler` because "slow" keyword suggests performance issue
- ‚úÖ `check_quality` with focus="performance" for bottleneck analysis

**Result**: Multi-faceted debugging combining code patterns, log analysis, and performance insights

## ‚ö° **CPU Throttling & Stability System** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Critical Issue Resolved**: VS Code crashes and terminal freezing during intensive file scanning operations have been completely eliminated through comprehensive CPU throttling implementation.

### **Problem Solved**
- **Before**: Operations like `review_output` and file analysis would cause 100% CPU usage, leading to VS Code crashes and Claude Code terminal freezing
- **Root Cause**: Inadequate `await asyncio.sleep(0)` calls in file scanning loops that didn't actually yield CPU control
- **After**: Smart CPU monitoring with real-time throttling prevents system overload while maintaining performance

### **CPU Throttling Implementation**

#### **Real-Time CPU Monitoring**
```python
class CPUThrottler:
    def __init__(self, max_cpu_percent: float = 80.0):
        self.max_cpu_percent = max_cpu_percent
        self.yield_interval_ms = 100  # Check CPU every 100ms
        
    async def yield_if_needed(self):
        """Intelligently yield CPU when usage is high"""
        current_cpu = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=0.1)
        if current_cpu > self.max_cpu_percent:
            # Longer yield for high CPU usage
            await asyncio.sleep(0.05)
        else:
            # Minimal yield for normal usage
            await asyncio.sleep(0.01)
```

#### **Smart File Scanning with Batch Processing**
```python
async def _collect_code_from_paths(self, paths: List[str]) -> str:
    """CPU-throttled file collection with batch processing"""
    if self.cpu_throttler:
        # Monitor heavy operation with context manager
        async with self.cpu_throttler.monitor_heavy_operation("file_collection"):
            # Process files in CPU-aware batches
            async for file_batch in self.cpu_throttler.throttled_file_scan(file_paths):
                for file_path in file_batch:
                    await self.cpu_throttler.yield_if_needed()  # Smart CPU yielding
                    content = await self._read_file_safe(str(file_path))
                    # Process content...
```

#### **Configuration Options**
```bash
# Environment Variables for CPU Throttling
MAX_CPU_USAGE_PERCENT=80.0           # CPU threshold for throttling (default: 80%)
CPU_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS=0.1       # CPU monitoring frequency (default: 100ms)
API_CALL_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS=0.5  # API call monitoring interval (default: 500ms)
FILE_SCAN_YIELD_FREQUENCY=50         # Files processed per CPU check (default: 50)
```
